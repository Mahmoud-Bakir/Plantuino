> A mobile app tha takes care of your homeplants even when you are not around them through and Arduino. It helps you in recognizing your plant, knowing its preferables, and opens a door for you to discover new plants on the market.
>
> Plantuino aims to streamline the nurtuting process of your homeplants by providing a user-friendly platform for users to get notified about their plants health and taking care of it in addition to a friendly chatBot. Plantuino places your homeplant in safe IOT hands.

### User Stories
- As a user I want to view daily graphical analysis about my homeplant so I can review itâ€™s progress.
- As a user, I want to chat with a bot, so I can know more about my homeplant.
- As a user I want to capture an image of my plant so that I can have information about it.
- As a user I want to buy other homeplants so that I can engrow my lovely garden.
- As a user I want to recieve push notifications so that I can be informed about my homeplant status.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

###  Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.

<!-- How to run -->
<img src="./readme/title6.svg"/>

> To set up Coffee Express locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

Now, you should be able to run Coffee Express locally and explore its features.
