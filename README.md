> Your go-to Arduino/mobile app for remote plant care while offering plant recognition, AI ChatBot, and market updates

<br>
Plantuino's primary goal is to help Plant Owners nurture their House Plants in a hybrid way by collecting vital data such as light,and moisture percentages and thus notifying the user about the plant's state. This data is gathered through sensors connected to an Arduino and sent to the mobile app that, after AI analysis of the plant type, compares it to its favorabile light and moisture percentages. If a deficiency or excess of light or moisture is detected, the app sends real-time notifications to the Plant Owner.Moreover, the arduino is responsible of supplying water to the plant if needed.The average moisture and light percentages are presented in charts that dynamically inform the user of the plant's moisture and light present percentages.Also, The app offers the feature of chatting with a ChatBot that can answer any of users' questions.
<br><br>
On a secondary level, the app connects Plant Owners to Plant Sellers and vice-versa through embeded markets; Plant Owners have the access to view Sellers products uploaded.
<br><br>
In addition, An Admin Dashboard is implemented to be able to view, edit, and delete users.
<br><br>

### User Types 

1. Plant Owner 
2. Seller
3. Admin



<br>

### Features of the App 
As a Plant Owner:
- View daily graphical analysis about my houseplant so I can review itâ€™s progress.
- Chat with a bot, so I can know more about my houseplant.
- Identify type of a plant so that I can have information about it.
- Buy other houseplants so that I can engrow my lovely garden.
- Recieve push notifications so that I can be informed about my hosseplant status.

As a Seller:
- Upload new products on my store so I can sell them to clients.
- Edit products details so that I can change them whenever I want.
- Delete a product so that it won't show to clients.

As an Admin:
- View All and specific type of users so that I can check for app activity.
- Create a new users so that I can add them to the community.
- Have access to edit actions so that I change user details 
- Have access to delete actions so that I can remove users

- This project uses:[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en). React Native is an open-source framework for building mobile applications. It's developed and maintained by Facebook and the React community. React Native allows developers to use JavaScript and React to build mobile applications that run on iOS and Android devices.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [Native Notify](https://nativenotify.com/) package which supports Android, iOS.
- For ChatBot, The app uses [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) which is responsible of generating answers to users questions.
- For AI Recognition, The app uses [Plant.id](https://plant.id/) API which is responsible of identifying the name of the photographed plant through uploading an image.
- To store users information, The app uses [Redux ToolKit] (https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) package which is capable of creating reducers for each type of information that needs to be saved.
- This app uses the font ["Raleway"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) as its main font and the fonto ["Robot"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as a font for numbers.The design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
